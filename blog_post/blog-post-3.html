            My Programming life started with C programming language. Remember the first day when I wrote my first line of code with C saying "Hello World".
            The C programming was a basic language which helped me to learn a lot. But for some moment I realized it was time consuming while solving some problems
            with it.<br>
            Then I got to know about my University bootcamp where I started learning C++ from scratch. Learnt a lot algorithm from there.How to solve them 
            using C++.Now, it has become my favourite language.Going to write some part of C++ which I really want to share.

        <h2>Why Choose C++?</h2>
        <p>There are many reason why you will choose this:</p>

        <p>Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ in 1983 as an expansion of the C language, adding object-oriented programming and other features to the language's strength and efficiency. 
            C++ is a compiled language that generates extremely efficient code, 
            which makes it appropriate for applications requiring high performance.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Features of C++</h3>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                1)Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)<br>
                2)Memory Management<br>
                3)Standard Template Library (STL)<br>
                4)Cross-Platform Capabilities<br>
                5)Extensive Libraries and Frameworks.
            </blockquote>

        <h2>What C++ Is Used For</h2>
        <h3>1)Game Development:<br></h3>
        <blockquote>
            C++ is used in game development a lot. It is Scripting language of Unreal Engine.
            C++’s capabilities allow for real-time performance that is crucial for complex games with high computational demands
        </blockquote>
        <h3>2)Financial Systems and High-Frequency Trading:<br></h3>
        <blockquote>
            In finance, C++ is used to build applications that require fast processing times and large-scale computations,
             such as high-frequency trading systems.
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>3)Real-Time Applications<br></h3>
        <blockquote>
            Industries like robotics, telecommunications, and aerospace rely on real-time applications to function effectively. 
        </blockquote>

        <h3>4)Machine Learning and AI<br></h3>
        <blockquote>
            While languages like Python dominate machine learning and AI,
             C++ is still widely used for training complex neural networks and deep learning models. Libraries like TensorFlow and Caffe,
             originally written in C++, offer high-performance solutions for building AI applications.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Resources for Learning C++:</h2>
        <p>If you want to learn you should find a mentor who can teach and guide you at the same time.But if you don't have this kind of thing you should check all these:</p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                1)Online Courses: Udemy, Coursera, and Pluralsight offer comprehensive C++ courses.<br>
                2)YouTube Channels: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T4mPpbNs_8&list=PLgH5QX0i9K3q0ZKeXtF--CZ0PdH1sSbYL" style="color: aliceblue;">Anisul Islam,</href></a>
                   <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y" style="color: aliceblue;">  FreeCode Camp,</href> </a>
                   
                    <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry" style="color: aliceblue;">CodeWithHarry </href></a> etc.<br>
               3)C++ path: In Bengali there is a full path for c++ in gihub.
               <a href=" https://github.com/I-K-Sakur/bangla-programming-resources" style="color: aliceblue;">বাংলায় প্রোগ্রামিং রিসোর্সসমূহ </href></a>
               
            <p>Try to follow the github link path and try to get in depth knowledge on C++.</p>
